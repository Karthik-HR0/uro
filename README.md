# URO - URL Processor

**URO** is a command-line tool for parsing and processing URLs from either a file or standard input. It extracts unique hosts and paths, tracks URL processing stats, and saves the results in an organized output file. URO is designed with simplicity, efficiency, and usability in mind, with real-time progress indicators to improve the user experience.
